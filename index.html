    <h1>Nature</h1>
    <p>The natural environment or natural world encompasses all biotic and abiotic things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.</p>
    <h2>Change Yourself not the Nature</h2>
